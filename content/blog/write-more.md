There are several reasons I am writing this post. 

1. I have been thinking about the kind of content I want to have uploaded in my blog.
2. A friend of mine, please checkout [his awesome blog](http://pedroir.nz/), recommended me to read the book "How to Take Smart Notes". An interesting little book that talks about the importance of the every day note taking. The book goes deeper in the why, how and even the where, but I am not going to explain all of that. I just mentioned it because it opened my eyes on how crucial it is to create a system so I can link the posts I create with one and other. Thanks Pedro.
3. My friend Jordan Peterson, my latest and greatest educator. He has very well explained how writing makes you a better thinker. That by itself is definitely a great goal, but it also made me think, how crucial is writing in our every day life. It can make a huge difference when writing an email to your manager, writing down documentation, or simply texting your friends and family. 
4. I simply want to be able to write down my ideas clearly and cohesively.

When I first started my blog I was a little bit confused on the type of content I wanted to upload. I had a clear vision of a blog bloated of tech posts and projects, which I will share with you, nevertheless there are tons of other topics I felt could be interesting to share. 

By that time, my friend Pedro coincidentally also started his own blog and had been going through the same dilema. That is how he came across "How to Take Smart Notes" and shared some of the knowledge with me. I've learnt so much from it I actually adopted some if it's knowledge to my blog and hopefully it will create a better reading experience. The key difference from the first version of my blog to my current one, as for today, is the addition of tags plus the relationship between posts. Now I can write about a certain topic, let's say javascript, and if I talk about subtopics let's say functional programming in JS, I can actually relate those posts between them. This way, posts about functional programming in JS are not lost in a sea of posts about javascript. I still have to try this out and experiment with it, as I might need to refine the system to make it even better. Nonetheless, as per today, I am satisfied and I can stressless write about any topic with the relief that even if I bloat my blog with posts, I will be able to filter the content and find what I want. 

Additionally, I believe it is a great exercise, Jordan Peterson has a lot of videos uploaded on youtube about the importance of reading, watch them; I wish I had done so sooner. To me it all comes down to: educate yourself. Be your best you. And this brings me to my last point.

I want to be able to transfer my thoughts into paper - or bytes. It seems like an easy exercise, but if you don't practise it often, or haven't at all, you might even find it stressing. On the other hand, successfully writing down what you have in your head can be a huge stress reliever. You may be stressing out about stuff. And the minute you manage to write down what is going through your head, it will feel like letting go. It will put your worries into perspective. But you don't necessarily have to write about problems, write about your passions too, crazy thoughts and specially wild and complicated theories you may have. Repeat this exercise over and over and you'll become an awesome communicator. 

After all, that's what we are here for, to communicate with others.
