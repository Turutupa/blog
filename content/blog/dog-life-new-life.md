Two months ago my girlfriend and I adopted a cute little dog. She is lovely and super smart. I soon understood what the dog love is all about, and why people lose their minds for their best friend. 

Unfortunately, today I came to learn a harsh dog fact. 

`- Viewer discretion advised -`

#### Dogs don't like hugs.

Of course there are some dogs that love hugging, and I am not talking about cuddling BTW, nonetheless, I was told today a very good exercise in case you don't believe it. If you going into google images and type something like *'hugging dog'*, you will find an incredible amount of pictures of people hugging a dog with....  *sad drum roll... uncomfortable* rolling. They are clearly not enjoying or find weird hugging, specially when the *supposely* owner is picking the dog up. 

I am guessing it is something we will just have to live with. Hopefully your dog will grow a hugger. 

I wish you and your dog the best!
