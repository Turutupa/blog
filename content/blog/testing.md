This would be **A TEST** on different *styles* I can add to my blog and see how they look like



# This would be heading 1

but I have a feeling I would very much better header 3

#### This is header 4

### And this is header 3

`npm i cf-create-app`

```
// This is some code block

const curry = fn = {
  const arity = fn.length;
  
  return function $curry(...args){
    if(args.length <= arity){
      return $curry.bind(null, ..args);
    }
    
    return fn.apply(null, args);
  }
}
```

And that's how you curry a function baby
