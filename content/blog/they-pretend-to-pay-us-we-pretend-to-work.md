title: They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work

I always believed a company pays employees the minimum amount so they stay in the company. No more, no less. Regardless of merit or hard work. In other other words, firms would pay the minimum that the workers would accept. And therefore, the classic negotiations when applying for a new job, fighting for a promotion or the end of the year performance review which could come with a salary increase.

In reality, this is not what they really want. As the book "Good economics for hard times" ingeniously points out, there is a Soviet joke: "They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work."

In reality, the logic for the wage to pay to workers has to be high enough that being fired actually hurts, the so called by economists, *efficiency wage*. And this actually makes way more sense. 

*How do you feel in regards of your salary?*
