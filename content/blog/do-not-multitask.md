Excerpt from "How to Take Smart Notes"

I have always known I am not a good multitasker; now I find it funny to realise no one is actually good at multitasking. Changing from one topic to another drains our energy thus making us less efficient. Having a lot of work to do is a totally different story. But those who believe they can efficiently multitask are actually doing worse than those focusing on one task at a time. 

> According to a widely cited study, the constant interruption of emails and text messages cuts our productivity by about 40% and makes us at least 10 IQ points dumber.

Nevertheless, I know I have fallen many times to confuse *familiarity with skill.* 

*\* Note: it is easy to tell yourself not to fool yourself, however, how do you do it?*
