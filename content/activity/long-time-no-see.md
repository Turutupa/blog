In the past months my life has change quite a bit but not as much as it plans to change. Here's some of the stuff I've been up to:

* Got accepted in the University of San Francisco in the MS in Computer Science program, wooohooooo!!!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
* Done a lot of administrative stuff for the student visa
* Left SAP - after a 4 year period my life at SAP has ended, and I must admit, it felt weird at first. But I am extremely excited for what comes next
* I have been working as a consultant: 

  * Orbit29: great agency, with young and ambitious leaders who engage in projects related to health. We worked in a project for the Movember Foundation (and seems I'll be working with Mo again for the next month and a half). My experience in Movember has been a blast! Great team, even better people
  * Direct client: created a small platform to help some local businesses promote themselves
* Trying to finish my doubles-tournament library. It's been in hold for too long, hopefully I'll be done soon
* Been listening to [Synthwave](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5dtGBIvNampf6lp7657CCu?si=59d3e33aea2d4656) and some other [weird stuff](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yc4EoseQaxO7wo0wz1Qzh?si=9dea3678dd37438c)
