title: Christmas times, happy times. Let's go 2021!
---
In the month of December I have...

* Applied to several universities for a Masters Degree in Computer Science. The process is not fun, actually it is quite exhausting, and although the ultimate goal when applying is to get accepted, during the application process you do learn some stuff. One of my biggest takeaways is definitely this: **learn to write**.
* I haven't had so much time to read this month but I finished the book *How to Take Smart Notes* and I am almost done with *Good Economics for Hard Times* which is filled with fantastic information, not only on economics, but how our world runs and how people adapt to it.
* As I have been quite busy with the MS applications, I haven't had so much time to code, nonetheless I have improved quite a bit in **golang**. If want to learn a new programming language, but you don't have much time to spend on a side project - which is the best way to learn - I highly encourage you to use [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). Spend 15 ~ 20mins a day solving coding problems and not only you'll improve your programming language skills but your problem solving skills.
* Bought a lot of presents and received tons of fantastic presents! I love them all, I am so grateful to have such loving friends and family in my life :)
* I haven't deeply thought about what I want for 2021 but my #1 wish is to be able to socialize more :)

Merry Christmas everyone and happy new year!
