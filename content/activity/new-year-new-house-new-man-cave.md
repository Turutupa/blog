In the month of January I have... 

* Moved into a new apartment! Not only we have more space, my girlfriend and I now have each a personal office, extremely convenient as we both have many calls and can be distracting. 

  She also gave me an **amazing** gift for my new office: a whiteboard! I **love** it!! I highly recommend one, the exercise of thinking while drawing/writing and easily erasing and re-drawing is so much fun!
* Added MailChimp to the blog! You can now subscribe and receive updates on my blog. You'll receive a maximum of one email every two weeks so hopefully it's not too spammy (and only if I have updated a new post).
* Inherited my mom's old iPad which I have been using heavy for reading. I used to read paperback books so it was a pleasant surprise to see that it is also quite comfortable to read in the iPad. Specially due to the backlight, it is a huge plus.
* Worked on a library to create round robin and brackets doubles tournament. It is an interesting project and turned out to be more complex than I initially expected. I'll write a blog post detailing more on this.
* Finished reading [Good economics for hard times](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Economics-for-Hard-Times/dp/0141986190/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)- I highly encourage you to read it, this one and [Factfulness](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250123828/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3RMPXF5N2DQ1K&dchild=1&keywords=factfulness&qid=1612719682&s=books&sprefix=factful%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C246&sr=1-1)*,* they'll both greatly change the way you see the world. 

  Read also [The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) - *fantastic* book. For other developers like myself with around 4 years of experience it was a nice and easy read, and definitely a mandatory one for developers who are starting their career. Every suggestion, recommendation or lesson are based on previous experience which the author doesn't sugar coat, and openly details his mistakes - to me this is a great reminder for oneself, *Do not fear to commit mistakes, keep trying.*
